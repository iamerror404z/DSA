# DSA Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **DSA Challenge** repository! This repository tracks my progress in mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** by solving problems on platforms like **HackerRank** and **LeetCode**.  

---

## 📌 Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Enhance my problem-solving and analytical skills.
- Prepare for coding interviews and technical assessments.
- Build a collection of well-documented and optimized solutions.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:



Each platform folder contains subfolders for different topics such as Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, etc.

---

## 💻 Platforms
Here are the platforms I'm using for this challenge:
1. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
2. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
The solutions are implemented using:
- **Python**
- **Java**
- Other languages depending on the problem requirements.

---

## 🏆 Goals
1. Solve at least one problem daily to maintain consistency.
2. Cover a variety of topics, including:
   - Arrays
   - Strings
   - Linked Lists
   - Trees
   - Graphs
   - Dynamic Programming
   - And more...
3. Write clean, efficient, and well-commented code.

---

## 📖 How to Use
1. Navigate to the platform folder (`HackerRank` or `LeetCode`).
2. Select the topic folder (e.g., `Arrays`, `Strings`).
3. Open the solution file to view the implementation.
